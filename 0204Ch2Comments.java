        // We use comments for:
        // - Adding your name to the program 
        // - Adding a brief description of the program 
        // - As you go along, explain to others (and yourself!) 
        // what your code should do 
        
        // Also... DEBUGGING 
        // If there is code that doesn't quite work (yet...)
        // If there are a bunch of lines of code that don't work
        // and you are trying to isolate where there is an error 
        
        
        // GIVE CREDIT 
        // If you use someone else's code, use comments to credit them and 
        // include the place where you got it from
        
        // ex. shamelessly stolen from https://github.com/awesomecoder 
        
        
        // HOW DO WE MAKE COMMENTS?
        
        // Line comments: anything after the // is ignored by the compiler 
        // Block comments: /*   */  (slash star star slash)(comment sandwich)
        // Java Doc comments: /**  */ (will automatically generate code documentation
        // we won't use these just yet
        
        // Examples:
        
        /* When you have multiple lines of comments
           it's helpful to do a block comment because 
           you can add as many lines as you want. 
           Good for program name/description at the top of the program.
